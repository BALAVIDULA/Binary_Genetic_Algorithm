# Binary_Genetic_Algorithm
Generating an optimized solution for the chromosome minimizing objective function using Binary GA.

Consider an equation having 3 decision variables attributing to a problem, and the cost function is 

                                    f(x,y,z) = 2x+3y+10z-3.6 

where each variable is coded by 10 bits:


                                Chromosome = [100101001111011101101111001101]

Where, the first 10 bits represent x, the second 10 bits represent y and the last 10 bits represent z.
